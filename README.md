💫 Hi, I’m Priya Chakraborty

🎓 MS in Computer Science (AI Track) @ Binghamton University
💻 Ex–Software Engineer (6+ years) 
🚀 Aspiring SRE 

💡 About Me

I’m a passionate engineer who thrives at the intersection of software engineering, cloud infrastructure, backend engineering
My journey has evolved from building large-scale Java Spring Boot microservices to architecting secure, scalable DevOps pipelines and deploying AI models for real-world impact.

When I’m not debugging distributed systems or optimizing CI/CD pipelines, you’ll find me reading about women’s rights, and peacebuilding — because I believe that technology and empathy together build better futures.
